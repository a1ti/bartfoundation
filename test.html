                  is a non-profit organization that provides a diverse array of
                  consultancy services to a variety of sectors. These services

                  Bougainvillea Art Foundation is a non-profit organization
                  dedicated to the preservation, promotion and documentation of
                  the vast cultural, historical, and natural heritage of our
                  great country India; a beautiful tapestry of diverse cultures,
                  ethnicities, traditions, and heritage. The Foundation strongly
                  believes that the connection of future generations with this
                  varied and rich culture needs to be established firmly so that
                  it stays connected with its roots and takes pride in imbibing
                  and passing it for future generations.

                <h4 class="mb-3 position-relative">
                  The Foundation is the brainchild of Dr Kaynat Kazi, who is
                  credited as the first female sole traveler of India. Dr Kazi
                  has traveled across the length and breadth of India and in the
                  journey accumulated the vast treasures of India's rich
                  cultural heritage through her lens. Kaynat wants to give the
                  immense love and appreciation that she received, back to the
                  society through the Bougainvillea Art Foundation.
